CSE 4/546: Reinforcement Learning      
Instructor: Alina Vereshchaka

Assignment 1 - Defining & Solving RL Environments

The goal of the assignment is to acquire experience in defining and solving reinforcement learning environments,following OpenAI Gymnasium standards. The assignment consists of three parts. The first focuses on defining deterministic and stochastic environments that are based on Markov Decision Process. In the second part we will apply two tabular methods to solve environments that were previously defined. In the third part we will apply Q-learning algorithm to solve a stock-trading environment.
